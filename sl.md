According to the internet, the command of sl will show a train running
so first i just enter sl then nothing pops out.
But it comes out with typing "sudo apt install sl"
and after that i got the train.
Well sl may be a package in my computer but not yet be intalled.
I am curious how many other interesting packages there could be in my computer.
And "sudo" may be something related to authority, still have no idea what shortform it is, remember to look it up.
Another problem is still could't figure out how to type CHinese under Linux or install qq.
